2. **Saving** device specific settings **per game** (e.g. Performance mode)
3. Supporting more **device specific features** for various handheld devices

    4. Open the HandheldExp menu with the toggle button
    5. Navigate to Other Settings > Load/Save State Setup > Start Setup
    6. The menu will now only react to touch input while you can navigate in RetroArch with your controller
    7. Select in RetroArch the Load State Setting
        1. Click via touch then on "Set Quick Load" in the HandheldExp Menu
    8. Select in RetroArch the Save State Setting
