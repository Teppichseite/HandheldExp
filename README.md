## üìÑ Concept
Currently emulation frontends launch **independent apps** for each system which is being played.
During the emulation session there is **no integration** of the frontend, while the emulator provides an in game menu
which is **drastically different** across other emulators and towards the frontend.

Additionally on Android Emulation Handhelds performing **certain actions** or changing **Android settings** during a play session requires most of the time **touch input**.

**HandheldExp** solves to aim these issues by providing **three key contributions**: 
1. **Full integration** with [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) on Android
2. **Uniform** in game menu across all emulators and apps 
3. Supporting the most **important actions** for a play session via **controller input**

In the end the goal is to provide a **seamless handheld experience** for Android as seen in the short showcase here:

## üéõÔ∏è Current State
The following shows the currently **supported devices** and its features

### ü§ñ Retroid Pocket 4 Pro
**Supported features**
1. In game Menu opening and closing
2. Display of game title, emulator and image provided by ES-DE
3. Chaning handheld specific settings
    - Performance mode

    - L2/R2 mode
4. Improving the overall handheld experience
    - Performance mode and fan mode will automatically reset when returnig to ES-DE
    - Navigating back to ES-DE will automatically close the recently opened emulator properly


## üöÄ Steps for the future
1. Supporting **more Settings** via the in game menu 
2. Provding a **proper app exit** approach which does not require simulated touch events
3. Supporting **Quck Save** and **Quick Load** for most Emulators
4. Supporting the most common **Android Handhels**
5. Supporting **auto remembering** of settings per game


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
**Overall the following apps will be required**
1. [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/#Download) Android as Frontend
2. [AnyHome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.draco.anyhome&hl=en) to set ES-DE as home app
3. [Keymapper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.sds100.keymapper&hl=de) to map the opening and closing button for the Menu
4. HandheldExp for the Menu itself

The full steps will be described soon.
